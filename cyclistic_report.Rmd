The following is a analytics report created as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone.

## The Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working with the marketing analyst team at the finctional company 
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The financial researchers at Cyclistic have 
determined that yearly members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. The 
company's future success, in the opinion of Lily Moreno, director of marketing, hinges on 
increasing the number of yearly subscribers. To turn casual riders into annual members, 
the marketing analytics team will create a new marketing plan. By analyzing past data for 
trends, the marketing team will be able to better understand how casual and annual-subscription 
Cyclistic riders use the service differently.


## The Data
We will use Cyclistic's historical trip data for the analysis in order to examine and 
pinpoint user trends. The information will be downloaded from a Cyclistic-provided AWS S3 
bucket and kept locally in a secure storage drive. Only the previous year (August 2021â€“
August 2022) will be included in the Analysis because we are looking at current patterns. 
Cyclistic directly gathered and keeps track of the data from user activity. Motivate 
International Inc. complies with [this](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) 
Data License Agreement in providing the data to the general public.

The trip data offered will be sufficient because we are searching for patterns in how 
consumers use the service. In order to undertake an accurate analysis, the data will need 
to be cleaned and examined for null or empty items. I am unable to use the riders' 
personally identifying information due to data privacy concerns. I won't be able to 
determine whether casual riders reside in the Cyclistic service region or whether they 
have purchased several passes by connecting pass purchases to credit card numbers.

Since I am given a choice between using the spreadsheet software Google Sheets or the 
programming language R, I choose to use R. With a scripted language like R, every 
part of the process is documented. Every step taken in the analysis is also documented. 
Additionally if this type of report is regularly required it can be generated automatically 
whenever needed.

## Data Cleaning

Although the data is from a trustworthy source, it is in less than ideal shape because 
some station names are missing and the GPS coordinates have been generalized. All GPS 
locations must have the same level of accuracy and be marked with station names and an 
ID in order to maintain the integrity of the data. Therefore, cleaning up the data by 
deleting rows of information that contain redundant or inconsistent data will make it more 
orderly. The data will also be cleaned and categorized with columns for ride duration and 
day of the week the ride began.

### Import tools to clean the data
To begin, I used the library tidyverse which is an opinionated set of R tools created for 
data research. Each package within tidyverse has a common data structure, language, and 
design philosophy which makes it ideal for our project.
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Load data into dataframe
Downloaded from Amazon Web Services, the original data is stored in a secure local drive and
extracted to a data folder. Prior to cleaning or analysis I inspected each CSV file using 
Excel ensuring column names match across all files. Using the method below, I am able to 
access the folder and import the data using the read_csv function and bind all matching 
row names. Finally, using the Janitor library we can clean the column names and ensure no
white space will confalte the analysis with errors.
```{r echo = TRUE}
csv_data <- list.files(path = "./data", full.names = TRUE) %>%
  lapply(read_csv) %>%
  bind_rows %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```
Using this dataframe we can begin to clean and process the data for analysis.


### Column names and total observations (rides)
Here is a list of column names (features) that are included in the dataset. These features
will provide us the basic information needed to find out how each customer type uses the 
ride share service.
```{r }
knitr::kable(colnames(csv_data),
  results = "asis", col.names = NULL,
  caption = "Column Names")
```


Looking at the dimensions of the data reveals the number of rows (rides recorded) by the 
number of columns (features) in the data. In this case the dimensions are 6,687,395 rides 
with 13 features in the dataset.
```{r }
knitr::kable(dim(csv_data), col.names = NULL,
  caption = "Dataset Dimensions")
```
With over 6 and a half million observations, there is plenty of room to clean and process 
the data.

### The cleaning process
So that our analysis can reflect the true habbits of Cyclistic customers, it is important 
to remove duplicate records from within the dataset. Using the unique ride IDs I am able to
create a new dataframe that only contains distinct ride IDs while also deleting rows with 
unavailable or null data.
```{r echo = TRUE}
dist_csv_data <- csv_data %>% distinct(ride_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% drop_na()
```
Normally, I wouldn't build a new dataframe; instead, R enables me to keep cleaning and 
processing the data without the need to produce extra dataframes. Separate dataframes will 
be used for the cleaning procedure for the purpose of clarity.


We can process data to create a ride length (in minutes) column and a week day column using 
the dataframe with unique ride IDs. I also included a month and hour of departure column.
```{r echo = TRUE}
preped_data <- dist_csv_data %>%
  mutate(ride_length = ((as.integer(ended_at) - as.integer(started_at)) / 60))

preped_data$hour_of_start <- lubridate::hour(preped_data$started_at)
preped_data$day_of_week <- lubridate::wday(preped_data$started_at)
preped_data$month_of_start <- lubridate::month(preped_data$started_at)
```


We need to make sure that any ride that is registered is from a client and not a 
maintenance worker. Below, I eliminated rows with inconsistent times if the start time was 
later than the end time once the ride duration has been determined. Additionally, I used 
the chance to eliminate rows whose start station and end station were the same, which could 
have been a sign of a customer who changed their mind or a maintenance worker.
```{r echo = TRUE}
preped_data <- subset(preped_data, ride_length > 0 &
  start_station_id != end_station_id)
```


Looking at a summary of the data we have processed so far, we can see the max and min of the 
ride length reveals the presence of outliers.
```{r }
summary(preped_data)
```

Even while we can see that each client type's average travel time (in minutes) is not 
particularly long, the existence of outliers can have an impact on the average, which can 
change how we see each customer type.
```{r }
knitr::kable(aggregate(preped_data$ride_length ~
  preped_data$member_casual, FUN = mean),
  results = "asis", format = "pandoc", col.names = NULL,
  caption = "Average Ride Length (Minutes) per Customer Type")
```


I established an upper and lower bound to handle outliers. Outliers are all observations 
that fall outside the range defined by the 1 and 99 percentiles. Next, I generated a list and
dataframe of outliers so that we may create a summary.
```{r echo = TRUE}
# Create the upper and lower bounds
lower_bound <- quantile(preped_data$ride_length, 0.01)
upper_bound <- quantile(preped_data$ride_length, 0.99)

# Create a list of row numbers of observations that is an outlier
outlier_list <- which(preped_data$ride_length < lower_bound |
  preped_data$ride_length > upper_bound)

# Use the outlier list to create a dataframe of outliers
quant_outliers <- preped_data[outlier_list, c("ride_id", "ride_length")]
```


Looking at a summary of the outliers, we can see that we were able to include the most 
important ones, such as outliers caused by bike maintenance or inordinately long rides.
```{r }
summary(quant_outliers)
```


Finally, I remove all outliers identified earlier and created a new dataframe for analysis.
```{r echo = TRUE}
processed_data <- preped_data[-outlier_list, ]
```


Over 4.5 million observations are still available for study after all data cleaning and 
processing. We can observe that the ride length upper and lower boundaries fall inside a 
range that is appropriate for renting a bike.
```{r }
summary(processed_data)
```


## Analysis
After the data has been cleansed and processed, we can now examine it for trends. We are 
comparing and contrasting how annual subscribers and occasional customers used the 
Cyclistic service over the course of the previous year.

### Number of rides
To begin we should first take a look at the total number of rides each customer type has made.

```{r }
knitr::kable(processed_data %>%
              group_by(member_casual) %>%
              summarise(total_rides = n()),
  format = "pandoc", col.names = NULL)
```

According to the table above, annual members ride more frequently. In actuality, there is 
a 37% difference between the two sorts of customers.

We can all agree that customers that pay an annual fee use the service more, but we still 
need to know more about when these customers use the service most and least. It makes 
sense that clients might utilize the service all year round, but when may demand rise?

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by rider type per month
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, month_of_start) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month_of_start, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma,
      breaks = seq(1, 12, 1), limits = c(0.5, 12.5)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

According to the graph above, demand increased steadily from March (3) through July (7), 
peaked in August (8), and then significantly decreased over the next three months. It 
makes sense that the spring and summer seasons would be the busiest, but August (8) 
truly jumps out because there is a notable demand for Cyclistic services.

Looking at each individual month below we can see the total number of rides for each 
day of the week. We can see that on Saturdays (7) and Sundays (1), casual users outperformed 
yearly members for the months of May (5) through October (10). Only in October (10) did 
annual members' peak on a Friday (6) or a Saturday (7); otherwise, they always peaked on any
day from Monday (2) through Thursday (5).

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 10, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by rider type per month
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week, month_of_start) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 7.5), breaks = seq(1, 7, 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    facet_wrap(~month_of_start) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

Illustrated below, it appears that occasional users outperform yearly members on the 
weekends throughout the months.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
# Visualization for number of rides by rider type per week day
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma,
      breaks = seq(1, 7, 1), limits = c(0.5, 7.5)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 11))
```

Consumers who would use Cyclistic during the weekdays appear to be annual members, but 
customers who enjoy the weekend prefer to use the service on a casual basis.

With an idea on how the customers may use the service through out the week each month. We should
also take a moment to consider how the customers use the service throughout the day.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by bike type per hour of the day
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, hour_of_start, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour_of_start, y = number_of_rides,
    fill = member_casual)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1),
      limits = c(-0.5, 23.5)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

The graph above displays the overall number of rides for the year broken down into a
24-hour period. Despite a significant decline in demand between the 23rd hour (11 p.m.) 
and the fourth hour (4 a.m.), it is clear that cyclistic is in demand around-the-clock. 
We can still claim that annual Cyclistic members primarily utilize the service for work with
peak use at 8 a.m., noon, and 5 p.m. It is only at 5 o'clock the casual user appears 
to reach their peak, with rides distributed rather evenly throughout the 24-hour period.

### Bike Type (Total Rides)

Having knowledge of how frequently each category of customer uses the service is important. 
Understanding how each kind prefers to bike is crucial for us. Understanding which of the 
three alternatives each customer selects may help us learn more about how they use 
Cyclistic.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by bike type per hour of the day
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, month_of_start, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month_of_start, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, 1), limits = c(0.5, 12.5)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    facet_wrap(~rideable_type) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

While clients have access to a variety of modes of transportation, the graph above shows 
total rides each month for each customer type for each bike type. showing us that there 
is a strong preference towards classic bikes. All three types of bikes have been utilized 
consistently throughout the course of the year, however annual members never use docked bikes.

Looking at the breakdown of total rides for each type of bike throughout a 7-day week in 
the graph below. It is evident that occasional riders and yearly members continue to favor 
the classic bike. Additionally, it appears that casual users use the docked bikes and 
they use the electric bikes more frequently on the weekends than do annual members.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by bike type per hour of the day
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 7.5), breaks = seq(1, 7, 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    facet_wrap(~rideable_type) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

We have now examined the overall number of rides throughout the previous year. We can infer 
that yearly members ride more frequently during the week during business hours and prefer 
to use a classic bike and occasionally an electric bike based on how each customer type 
uses Cyclistic. Although they prefer the classic bike, casual users prefer to utilize the 
service on weekends in the evening and will also use the other two types of bikes.

### Average Ride Time
Only a limited amount of information about each customer types' habits can be gleaned from 
understanding the users through the frequency of their rides. The average amount of time an 
annual member or casual user spends riding their selected bike is the next topic of 
discussion. The table that follows displays the total mean average usage time (in minutes) 
for each user's type.

```{r }
knitr::kable(aggregate(processed_data$ride_length ~
                processed_data$member_casual, FUN = mean),
  results = "asis", format = "pandoc", col.names = NULL)
```

We may examine the average time (in minutes) that each client rode their bike each month 
throughout the previous year, just as we did with the total number of rides each customer 
took. As you can see below, casual users spend more time on their bikes even if annual 
members ride more regularly.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by rider type per month
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, month_of_start) %>%
  summarise(average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month_of_start, y = average_duration,
    fill = member_casual, colour = member_casual)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, 1), limits = c(0.5, 12.5)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

According to the graph above, the highest ride time for casual users occurs between March 
(3) and September (9). May is the month when casual riders spend the most time on their 
bike (5). Regular annual members limit their rides to shorter durations, with their peak 
season starting in May (5) and ending in September (9). It is not surprising that the 
average ride duration decreases during the Fall and Winter seasons.

After examining the average ride time for each user as a whole, we can further break down 
the year and examine the average ride time for each day of the week and each month.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 10, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by rider type per month
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week, month_of_start) %>%
  summarise(average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_duration,
    fill = member_casual, colour = member_casual)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 7.5), breaks = seq(1, 7, 1)) +
    facet_wrap(~month_of_start) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

As their peak season starts and spring ushers in warmer weather, we can observe 
above that ride lengths for the casual user grow increasingly volatile. The average 
trip time levels off as the peak period for casual users goes on, with weekend highs and 
decreased weekday usage. Although their season doesn't start until May (5), the yearly 
members' ride durations start to slightly increase in March (3), similar to the casual 
users. Once more, it is clear that yearly members do not ride their bikes very often.


It's interesting to see that, like casual users, annual member ride duration peaks on the 
weekends. Although the ride durations of casual riders are longer, both utilization seems 
to rise and fall on days that are similar.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
# Visualization for average duration of ride per rider type per week day
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_duration,
    fill = member_casual, colour = member_casual)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 7.5), breaks = seq(1, 7, 1)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 11))
```

The graph above shows that despite the difference in average ride lengths, both occasional 
users and yearly members choose similar days.

Examining the typical ride time for each type of customer. The graph below displays the 
average time spent by each customer type during a 24-hour period.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by bike type per hour of the day
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, hour_of_start) %>%
  summarise(average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour_of_start, y = average_duration,
    fill = member_casual, colour = member_casual)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 1),
      limits = c(-0.5, 23.5)) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

With dips in the early morning hours at 5 a.m. and a gradual rise until about 2 p.m., annual 
members continue to maintain a modest and almost consistent ride duration. Casual users 
appear to reach their peak at 10 a.m., which lasts through 2 p.m., then declines to an average, 
which holds through 3 a.m., then lowers for the night before picking up at 8 a.m. once more.

### Bike Type (Average Duration)

Now that we know when each sort of consumer likes to use the service and for how long 
they typically enjoy riding. The average riding time for each type of customer and 
each bike type for each month of the year is broken down below. We can see that the 
average user will spend roughly the same amount of time on both the classic and the 
electric bike during their peak season, which runs from March (3) through September (9). 
Additionally, we can anticipate that casual customers will use the docked bike for 
significantly longer than usual, particularly from May (5) through June (7).

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by bike type per hour of the day
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, month_of_start, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month_of_start, y = average_duration,
    fill = member_casual, colour = member_casual)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, 1), limits = c(0.5, 12.5)) +
    facet_wrap(~rideable_type) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

In addition to the aforementioned, we can also claim that annual members ride both 
traditional and electric bikes, with average ride times distributed throughout the year 
and the longest ride durations occurring during the peak season (May to September).

Below is a breakdown of the typical riding time for each type of customer for each day of 
the week on each type of bike. We may observe that each sort of consumer selects 
comparable days to boost use throughout the course of the week. Casual users appear to 
utilize docked bikes for a significantly longer average time than other bikes.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 14}
# Visualization for number of rides by bike type per hour of the day
processed_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week, rideable_type) %>%
  summarise(average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_duration,
    fill = member_casual, colour = member_casual)) +
    geom_point(size = 5) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 7.5), breaks = seq(1, 7, 1)) +
    facet_wrap(~rideable_type) +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

We have now looked at the typical ride length for each category of customers over the past 
year. We can assume that casual users ride longer on the weekends particularly during the 
spring and summer from late morning through latter afternoons. Longer trips on docked bikes are also taken by casual users who utilize 
both traditional and electric bikes. The yearly member prefers electric and classic bikes 
when using the Cyclistic service, even if they maintain a low consistent average ride duration 
with weekly peaks similar to casual users.

### Geospatial Analysis

Although we have a complete picture of our clients' riding patterns throughout the year, 
it's crucial to comprehend why they choose to use the Cyclistic service. The data 
given included GPS information for each ride taken over the previous year. Using Tableau, 
I plotted the top 10 stations each sort of consumer utilized to begin their ride, and 
I've embedded interactive maps below. We will only look at the overall number of rides 
per station per client category in order to keep the analysis focused on our current objectives.

As seen above, yearly users like to start their journeys from locations like Kingsbury St. 
& Kinzie St., where there are several parks, eateries, and cafes in the vicinity. The 
Clark & Elm St station, where there is a wealth of retail nearby, as well as public 
transportation hubs that one can reach by using a bike from Cyclistic. While we are unsure 
of the exact destinations that our yearly customers are going to, we can say that, with 
average journey times of about 12 minutes, they are not traveling very far.

After examining annual members, we can move on to casual users. As seen above, casual 
users like stations that are close to tourist attractions. Casual users have specifically 
frequented the Streeter Dr. & Grand Ave. station, which is close to Ohio Street Beach, 
Lake Point Tower, and Pier Park. The North Western University Chicago Campus and the 
Lakeshore East Park, which is close by and has hotels and restaurants, are both accessible 
from the Streeter Dr. & Grand Ave. station.

## Insight

In order to investigate and identify user trends that will enable us to more fully 
comprehend how annual members and casual Cyclistic users utilize the service 
differently, we had to look at past data that Cyclistic had supplied. We used R to 
prepare and analyze data that we had downloaded from an AWS S3 bucket. We also utilized 
Tableau to perform GIS analysis. By analyzing the overall number of rides, we can 
conclude that annual members, who prefer classic bikes, ride more frequently than 
casual members, who also prefer classic cycles but will also ride electric, and that 
casual members are the only customer category that will ride a docked bike.

Although casual members bike for longer, yearly members ride more frequently 
during the week during business hours, keeping the average ride time modest and constant. 
Weekend evenings are when casual members tend to use the service. According to the GIS 
study, if the top 10 stations are any indicator, annual members will stick to stations 
inside the city that are close to public transportation, while casual users would 
frequently utilize stations near busy areas. The best understanding of why Cyclistic 
consumers use the service would come from further GIS research as well as more data on 
user habits.
